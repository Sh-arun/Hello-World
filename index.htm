    Thomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847 to Nancy and Sam Edison, in Milan, Ohio.  He was the youngest of seven children,  four of whom lived until adulthood.  Nancy Elliot, his mother, was from New York and then moved along with her family to Vienna, Canada where she met her future husband, Sam Edison Jr.  As  a child, Edison was a very poor student.  His mother began teaching him after his schoolmaster proclaimed him to be “addled”.  He showed an interest in mechanics and chemical experiments.

          In 1859, Thomas Eidons saved the life of a station official’s three year old child while working for the railroad.  To thank him, the father taught Thomas how to use the telegraph.  Thomas began working as a telegrapher between the US and Canada.  He experimented ways to improve the drive, leading to his inventions, the automatic telegraph, the duplex telegraph, and the message printer.  This was the beginning of his life as a full-time inventor.  Edison continued to work on the telegraph and other inventions.

           Between 1878 and 1880, Edison worked on many theories to develop an incandescent lamp.  It is said that Edison failed 1,000 times before successfully inventing the light bulb. In January 1879, Edison had built his first incandescent electric light.  He continued to innovate it so that it would last for longer periods of time.  In the early 1880s, Thomas Edison planned the construction of the first central power station in NYC.  Before his death, Thomas patented 1,093 of his inventions.  Some of them include the microphone, the telephone receive, and the phonograph.
